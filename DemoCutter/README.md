Standalone demo cutter for dm_15 and dm_16 files based on jamme/jomme source code.

Code is lifted and adapted from https://github.com/entdark/jaMME/ and https://github.com/entdark/jk2mp/

All credit for the basic demo cutting functionality goes to entdark. Lots of functions from the Jedi Knight source code releases included as well.
