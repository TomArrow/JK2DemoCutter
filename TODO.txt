automatically save invalid delta frame thingie
better prediction for laggy demos with gravity?
detect changes of who is spectated! (and if so add teleport flag) EF_TELEPORT_BIT
What about player state / player entity events? How to handle those? 
Obituary event makes zero sense atm... lol. Just using original clientnums that make no sense in the new demo
look at BG_EvaluateTrajectory for non player entity trajectories
and BG_PlayerStateToEntityStateExtraPolate and CG_AddToHistory for player entity trajectories
Clean up older SnapshotInfos (that are just too old to be useful, like 30+ sec?) to save RAM on long demos.
Make demos identifiable so I can avoid re-cutting them
should we properly map event entities too?
solve CROUCH when info comes from entities.

DONE:
