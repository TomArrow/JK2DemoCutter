lost packet count
keep date modified
dbs speed
top10 inferred (top10i)
automatically save invalid delta frame thingie
better prediction for laggy demos with gravity?
detect changes of who is spectated! (and if so add teleport flag) EF_TELEPORT_BIT
What about player state / player entity events? How to handle those? 
Obituary event makes zero sense atm... lol. Just using original clientnums that make no sense in the new demo
look at BG_EvaluateTrajectory for non player entity trajectories
and BG_PlayerStateToEntityStateExtraPolate and CG_AddToHistory for player entity trajectories
Clean up older SnapshotInfos (that are just too old to be useful, like 30+ sec?) to save RAM on long demos.
Make demos identifiable so I can avoid re-cutting them
should we properly map event entities too?
solve CROUCH when info comes from entities.
Remember or even interpolate Health/Armor when getting info from entity state? Maybe even ... infer health and such from hit info?

weapon select wheel when switching between entity and playerstate
I think this is reason for weapon select issue maybe:
if ( ps->persistant[PERS_SPAWN_COUNT] != ops->persistant[PERS_SPAWN_COUNT] ) {
		CG_Respawn();
	}
Maybe always remember last known full playerstate and copy some stuff from it...
Do a demo merger. combines multiple demos of same game...
MAYBE: detect unintentional kills? where killer wasnt looking at victim? kinda pointless tho due to bs/dbs
some way to filter out afk kills and weirdo shit in ffa
Dont keep old stuff, it makes stuff slow the bigger the files are. clear the maps regularly, e.g. kills and speeds
track highest place anyone's ever been!
track kills where killer jumped over someone else's head. and how many heads? or just. track headjumps before the kill.
detect allahu akhbar


DONE: 

TODO: Make it overwrite kills in the database if the ones in database are third person and the new one is first person DONE (via split angles and kills)
TODO: Have it separate kill and angle. Makes more sense. To know what a demo exists of. Otherwise its just the first one that happens to be analyzed in the database. DONE
Maybe write server name/subtext and playermodels into thing as well. Thing I mean... database. DONE
add timestamp to killstreaks too DONE
save duration for killstreaks DONE
solve terminated by signal 11 on some demos HOPEFULLY SOLVED?
detect teleport KINDA DONE
demoCurrentTime happens after parsesnapshot but we add commands in parsesnapshot? FALSE ALARM I THINK, REMEMBERED WRONG
EV_PLAYER_TELEPORT_IN DONE
EV_PLAYER_TELEPORT_OUT DONE
sv_hostname in 0 and configstring 4 DONE
